README.txt
This is a simple text file that contains the README for the project.
I am going to document the setup process for the project.


1. setup cursor to work with codespaces. You must know your email address and know your GitHub password.
    prerequisites:
        A GitHub Codespace already created
        GitHub CLI installed (gh)
        Cursor installed (https://cursor.sh)
        SSH working on your machine
    Create an SSH key.
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"  # C:\Users\dines/.ssh/id_ed25519
        cat C:\Users\dines\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub
    Add the SSH key to GitHub
        Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
        Click "New SSH key"
        Give it a descriptive title (e.g., "Cursor IDE")
        Paste your public key
        Click "Add SSH key" . Github will prompt you to enter your password.

    Test the connection
        ssh -T git@github.com
    gh auth login
    gh auth refresh -h github.com -s codespace # Give authorization to access the codespace.
    gh codespace list # List all codespaces.
    gh codespace ssh --config my-codespace-name # Connect to the codespace.
    

# 🧊 PySpark and Apache Iceberg Local Development Setup

This guide provides the steps to set up a local development environment using **Poetry** for package management, **PySpark** for big data processing, and **Apache Iceberg** as the high-performance table format.

The setup leverages a local **Hadoop-based SparkCatalog** for Iceberg development.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system (Windows or macOS/Linux):

* **Python 3.x**
* **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** (Required for Spark and Iceberg)
* **pip** (Python package installer)

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Poetry

**Poetry** is used to manage dependencies and create isolated project environments.

```bash
pip install poetry


# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir iceberg_pyspark_project
cd iceberg_pyspark_project

# Initialize a new Poetry project (follow the prompts, you can accept defaults)
poetry init

# Create a virtual environment within the directory
python -m venv .venv
Platform,Command to Activate
macOS/Linux,source .venv/bin/activate
Windows (Git Bash),source .venv/Scripts/activate
Windows (CMD/PowerShell),.venv\Scripts\activate

poetry add --group=dev pyspark ipykernel

# Install Jupyter (if not already installed globally)
pip install jupyter

# Install the current environment as a Jupyter kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=iceberg_env --display-name "Iceberg PySpark Dev"

# Start the Jupyter Notebook server
jupyter notebook
